                    <p> Pete and Joe share a deep commitment to leveraging technology as a force for good. With extensive experience in software engineering and organizational strategy, they co-founded Quartzion Technology Solutions Corp. to bridge the gap between innovation and impact.
                        Recognizing that many mission-driven organizations are underserved by high-cost consulting models, they set out to deliver affordable, scalable, and purpose-built technology solutions tailored to the unique needs of nonprofits, grassroots initiatives, and socially conscious teams.
                        Their vision is clear: empower organizations with the tools they need to streamline operations, improve community access, and scale their impact—without sacrificing their budget or values.</p>
